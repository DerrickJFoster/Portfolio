I am a software engineer and I have always been intrigued by technology. Since a young child I was taking things apart, from R/C cars to PCs I was always looking to find what made it “tick”. I’ve taken that mindset throughout my working career. I am always dissecting the situations or systems and figuring out how I can make them more efficient for not only myself but everyone involved. Doing so has sparks my creative side as well, creating something functional that looks great and operates at a high efficiency is what I strive to do.
